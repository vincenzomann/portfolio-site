          I have graduated with a First-Class in BEng Computer Systems
          Engineering and I have 1 year of industry experience. My strong
          communication skills and positive, determined and open-minded attitude
          make me a valuable team player. I work diligently, methodically and
          efficiently in any task and I'm always willing to learn new concepts,
          skills or frameworks that can strengthen my knowledge, code quality
          and task delivery. I have a keen eye for detail and I love using my
          creativity to design solutions and contribute ideas.
